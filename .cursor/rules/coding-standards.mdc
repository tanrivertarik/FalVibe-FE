# Coding Standards for FalVibeExpoReact

Follow the ESLint rules defined in [eslint.config.js](mdc:eslint.config.js).

- Use consistent indentation (2 spaces).
- Always use semicolons.
- Prefer const over let where possible.
- Use arrow functions for callbacks.
- Ensure all components and hooks are properly typed using TypeScript.

Refer to the ESLint config for detailed rules and run ESLint to check compliance.
